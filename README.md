# Developer Mindset Project


## Summary:
The goal of this project is to find out what do the developers think with repect to education, development softwares and employee benefits. The data analysis is performed on the dataset provided by Stack Overflow. This data is basically taken from Stack Overflow's Developer survey conducted in the year 2017.

The project uses the required steps in the CRISP-DM process:
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Data Modeling
5. Results Evalluation
6. Model Deployment


## Business Understanding
There were so many questions as part of the survey. I was particularly interested to know the answers for the following questions:
1. What type of education did the developers pursue outside the formal education?
2. What are all the commonly preferred IDEs used by the developers according to the employment status?
3. What kind of employee benefits do the developers prefer?


## Installations:

The below libraries are used in this project:

1.) Data Science Libraries
import pandas as pd

2.) To provide alternatives to built-in container data types
from collections import defaultdict

3.) For data visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

4.) To render pandas dataframe in Jupyter Notebook
import qgrid

5.) Interactive HTML widgets for Jupyter Notebooks
import ipywidgets as widgets


## File Descriptions:

The project contains the following files and directories:

	1. Developer's Mindset Project.ipynb: Jupyter notebook that contains the code related to this project

	2. survey_results_public.csv: csv file containing survey results data

	3. survey_results_schema.csv: csv file containing the survey questions
		
	4. project_snapshots: directory containing project snapshots


## Instructions to run the project:
To execute the code, please follow the below steps in your local system
1. Upload the files and folder available in the GitHub repository to the Jupyter Notebook Workspace
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook - Developer's Mindset Project.ipynb and execute all the cells
